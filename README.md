**Describe what you want. The Factory builds it, tests it, and keeps improving it — autonomously.** A CEO agent orchestrates eight specialists — each running as an independent [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) subprocess. See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for the full deep-dive.

All state is local — per-project in `.factory/` (add to `.gitignore`), global in `~/.factory/`.

---

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (installed and authenticated).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akashgit/remote-factory.git
cd remote-factory
uv sync
```

Every command runs from the **factory repo directory** — you pass the target project as an argument:

```bash
uv run factory ceo "Build a personal homepage with a blog" --mode interactive
```

See the [full setup guide](docs/setup.md) for authentication and environment variables.

## What Do You Want to Do?

| I want to… | Command |
|---|---|
| **Start from a raw idea** | `uv run factory ceo "my idea" --mode interactive` |
| **Build from a spec or repo** | `uv run factory ceo spec.md` |
| **Improve an existing project** | `uv run factory ceo /path/to/project` |
| **Fix or add one thing** | `uv run factory ceo /path --focus "add dark mode"` |
| **Target a GitHub issue** | `uv run factory ceo /path --focus 42` |
| **Optimize a metric (research)** | `uv run factory ceo "build a harness to solve HMMT Feb 2026 C7" --mode research` |

---

## Interactive Workflow

Use interactive mode when you want to brainstorm before building. Start a conversation with the CEO to refine an idea, then build:

```bash
# From a raw idea — discuss and refine into a buildable spec
uv run factory ceo "distributed task runner" --mode interactive

# From a spec file — read and discuss before building
uv run factory ceo ~/ideas/my-app-spec.md --mode interactive
```

Interactive mode also works on existing projects. The CEO studies the backlog, eval scores, open issues, and experiment history, then discusses what to work on before executing:

```bash
uv run factory ceo ~/factory-projects/my-app --mode interactive

# Seed the conversation with a topic
uv run factory ceo ~/factory-projects/my-app --mode interactive --focus "auth layer"
```

---

## Build Workflow

When you already have a spec file, a GitHub repo, or a clear description, the Factory builds directly — no interactive step needed:

```bash
uv run factory ceo ~/ideas/spec.md
uv run factory ceo https://github.com/user/repo
uv run factory ceo "Build a personal homepage with a blog"
```

The pipeline: **Researcher** surveys best practices → **Strategist** creates a plan → **Builder** implements and commits → **E2E gate** confirms it runs. Override the output directory with `--dir my-site`. (If you start with a raw idea via `--mode interactive`, the CEO refines it into a spec first, then transitions into this same build pipeline automatically.)

After the first build, a backlog appears at `.factory/strategy/backlog.md` — deferred features that feed future improvement cycles. Manage it with `uv run factory backlog-list`, `uv run factory backlog-add`, and `uv run factory backlog-remove`.

---

## Improve + Focus Workflow

Point the Factory at an existing project and it enters Improve mode automatically:

```bash
uv run factory ceo ~/factory-projects/my-app
```

Each cycle: **observe** → **hypothesize** → **build** → **review** → **measure** → **decide** (keep or revert) → **archive**. The Strategist picks work from the backlog using FEEC priority (Fix > Exploit > Explore > Combine).

When you know exactly what you want, `--focus` pins a single target — one hypothesis, one experiment, done:

```bash
uv run factory ceo ~/my-app --focus "add dark mode toggle"
uv run factory ceo ~/my-app --focus 42                       # GitHub issue
uv run factory ceo ~/my-app --focus "owner/repo#42"          # Issue shorthand
```

Other ways to steer: file GitHub issues (the Strategist reads them), add to the backlog manually, or pass a spec file with `--prompt`.

---

## Research Mode

Research mode optimizes a **measurable metric** against a dataset — benchmarks, model tuning, prompt optimization, solver agents. The Factory is a meta-harness: give it a research objective and it builds the evaluation harness, then iteratively improves the system under test.

```bash
uv run factory ceo "build a harness to solve SWE-bench lite" --mode research
```

The CEO collects your research target (metric, run command), mutable surfaces (files the Builder can change), and fixed surfaces (ground truth — never touched). Each cycle runs: **baseline** → **failure analysis** → **research** → **hypothesize** → **build** → **re-measure** → **keep/revert**. The metric ratchets forward — it can never go below the previous best.

Once the project is set up, wrap it in a loop for continuous optimization — each cycle is a full experiment pass:

```bash
uv run factory ceo ~/my-solver --loop
uv run factory ceo ~/my-solver --loop --interval 900    # Custom interval
uv run factory tmux ~/my-solver --loop                  # Detached tmux session
```

The factory auto-detects the research target in `factory.md` and enters research mode. Failed experiments don't stop the loop — the factory learns from them and moves on.

| Project | Metric | What the factory optimizes |
|---------|--------|---------------------------|
| SWE-bench solver | resolve rate | Agent logic, prompts, localization strategies |
| Math reasoning | solve rate | Chain-of-thought templates, tool call patterns |
| Text/Sketch → CAD | query accuracy | Query builder, schema mapping, entity resolution |

See [Getting Started — Research Mode](docs/getting-started.md#research-mode-in-detail) for phase tables, leakage guards, and progression details.

---

## Eval System

Every change is measured by an 11-dimension composite score across three tiers: **Hygiene** (tests, lint, types, coverage), **Growth** (API surface, experiment diversity, observability), and **Project** (user-defined domain metrics). On first run, `uv run factory discover` auto-detects your project's language and framework to generate the eval profile. See [Eval System](docs/eval.md) for scoring details, weights, and guards.

---

## Self-Evolving Agents (ACE)

The Factory improves itself. Every keep/revert decision becomes training data — **ACE (Autonomous Context Engineering)** runs a Reflect → Curate → Inject loop that evolves agent playbooks from real experiment outcomes. Rules that correlate with kept experiments get reinforced; rules from reverts get pruned. Run `uv run factory ceo /path --mode meta` on a regular cadence. See [ACE Self-Improvement](docs/ace.md).

## Plugin Agents

Every factory agent is available as a standalone Claude Code subagent:

```bash
uv run factory install                   # Install all 9 agents to ~/.claude/agents/
claude --agent factory-ceo "improve this project"
claude --agent factory-researcher "study the auth system"
```
