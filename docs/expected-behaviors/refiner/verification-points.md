# Refiner — Verification Points

## Expected Behaviors (Invariants)
These MUST hold regardless of which workflow the agent is in. Check these against the agent's trace.

- [ ] Reads `CLAUDE.md` and `factory.md` before classifying
- [ ] Classifies the request as exactly one of Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3
- [ ] Tier 1: 1-3 files, <50 lines, no new dependencies
- [ ] Tier 2: 3-8 files, 50-200 lines, may add minor dependencies
- [ ] Tier 3: 8+ files, 200+ lines, architectural changes, new modules
- [ ] When in doubt between two tiers, chooses the higher tier (conservative)
- [ ] Classifies ambiguous or underspecified requests as Tier 3 with a clarification note
- [ ] Classifies requests requiring `eval/score.py` or `.factory/` modifications as Tier 3
- [ ] Bumps up one tier when the request requires adding new test files (not just modifying existing)
- [ ] Lists every file that would need to change, with line-range estimates where possible
- [ ] Produces a Builder Task Description that is self-contained — Builder should not need to re-analyze the codebase
- [ ] Builder Task Description includes: files to modify, what to change, constraints/gotchas, verification steps
- [ ] Includes verbatim copy of the user's refinement request in the output
- [ ] Output follows the exact structured format: Request, Tier, Rationale, Files to Modify, Estimated Scope, Builder Task Description
- [ ] Uses only read-only operations throughout (grep, find, cat, git log, git diff)

## Failure Modes
| Signal in trace | Indicates |
|---|---|
| Builder changes significantly more files than Refiner predicted | Under-scoping — wrong tier, Builder gets incomplete spec |
| Builder makes its own grep/find calls to understand the codebase | Vague Builder task — task description not self-contained |
| Tool log shows Edit/Write/Bash commands with side effects | State-changing commands executed — project state corrupted |
| Builder discovers files not in "Files to Modify" list | Missed file identification — actual scope may exceed tier |
| Output missing any of the 6 required sections | Incomplete output — CEO review and tier gate may malfunction |
