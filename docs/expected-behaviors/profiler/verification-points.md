# Profiler — Verification Points

## Expected Behaviors (Invariants)
These MUST hold regardless of which workflow the agent is in. Check these against the agent's trace.

- [ ] Produces exactly 7 sections in this order: Technical Identity, Architecture Patterns, Decision Heuristics, Quality Bar, Style & Taste, Anti-Patterns, Working Cadence
- [ ] Each section is 4-8 lines of flowing prose paragraphs — no bullet lists
- [ ] Uses third person throughout ("The user prefers...", "They consistently...") — never first or second person
- [ ] Every claim has a parenthetical citation to specific evidence (experiment numbers, memory file names, playbook item IDs, strategy file names)
- [ ] When evidence is sparse, honestly states so: "Limited evidence suggests..." or "No clear pattern emerges from the available data"
- [ ] No hedging filler — no "It appears that...", "It seems like...", "Perhaps..." — states directly or declares uncertainty explicitly
- [ ] When evidence conflicts (e.g., user force-kept a score-negative experiment but reverted a similar one), resolves the tension with likely reasoning rather than listing both facts
- [ ] Captures both explicit preferences (from auto-memory corrections) and implicit preferences (from experiment keep/revert patterns)
- [ ] No sections omitted, reordered, or added beyond the required 7

## Failure Modes
| Signal in trace | Indicates |
|---|---|
| Profile claims lack parenthetical citations | Ungrounded claims — profile cannot be verified, agents act on fabricated preferences |
| Output contains markdown list markers (`-`, `*`, `1.`) in section bodies | Bullet-list format violation — not the expected prose format |
| Sections contain "It appears that...", "Perhaps...", "might..." | Hedging language — agents get weak, unusable signals |
| Anti-Patterns and Decision Heuristics thin despite many experiments available | Missing implicit preferences — only captured explicit corrections, missed experiment patterns |
| Contradictory data points listed side-by-side without resolution | Tension avoidance — agents receive contradictory guidance |
| Fewer or more than 7 sections, or sections in wrong order | Structural violation — downstream consumers expect exact format |

## Playbook Rules
No evolved playbook rules for this agent.
